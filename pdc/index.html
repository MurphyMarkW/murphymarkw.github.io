        <h3><a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>
        <p align="justify">Hi there! You've found your way to Mark's Whacky Waving Inflatible Arm Flailing PDC Tutorials! As a beta tester for the new Protected Data Cloud at the University of Chicago, I thought it would be helpful to put together a few tutorials, tips, tricks and gotchas for utilizing the new PDC system. Let's get started!</p>

        <h3><a name="logging_in" class="anchor" href="#logging_in"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Logging in!</h3>
        <p align="justify">Logging into the PDC system is just like logging in to any other system via ssh. However, only login via pubkey is allowed - so no passwords! This makes the login process much more secure. If you haven't already done so, you can generate a new ssh key-pair using the following commands:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Generate an ssh pubkey key-pair.
% ssh-keygen -f id_local -N <password>
{% endhighlight %}

        <p align="justify">This will generate two files: <b>id_local</b> and <b>id_local.pub</b>. Note: <b>id_local</b> must be kept private at all times! If it is ever made public, you should regenerate your key-pair. However, <b>id_local.pub</b> is intended to be made public - this is the part of the key-pair that is uploaded to servers to gain ssh access. For now, the Tukey interface that supports loading your public key, <b>id_local.pub</b>, is down. So you'll need to send off a support email with your public key attached. Once it's loaded, you'll be able to log in with the following commands:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Log on to PDC using your private key!.
% ssh -A -i id_local <username>@bionimbus-pdc.opensciencedatacloud.org
{% endhighlight %}

        <p align="justify">To make logging on to virtual machines easier, you can load your public key into the OpenStack controller:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Copy public key to the PDC server.
% scp -i id_local id_local.pub <username>@bionimbus-pdc.opensciencedatacloud.org:~/

# Log on to PDC.
% ssh -A -i id_local <username>@bionimbus-pdc.opensciencedatacloud.org

# Load public key into OpenStack controller.
% nova keypair-add --pub-key id_local.pub <pubkey_name>
{% endhighlight %}

        <h3><a name="virtual_machines" class="anchor" href="#virtual_machines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Virtual machines!</h3>

        <p align="justify">PDC, being a full OpenStack system, is designed with virtual machines in mind. This allows PDC to lease out resources to users on-demand, giving users access to isolated, private and fully customizable environments. Let's start off with launching a virtual machine and see how we can get started building a system!</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# First we'll start up a new virtual machine instance.
# We do so by indicating:
#   1. A saved copy of a virtual machine - the base template for our instance.
#   2. The flavor of hardware we want - the number of cpus, memory, etc.
#   3. Which public key to use for controlling ssh access.
#   4. The name of the new virtual machine instance.
% nova boot --image Ubuntu-14.04-LTS-20140607 --flavor m1.xxlarge --key-name <pubkey_name> <instance_name>

# Next, we'll wait until the machine is up and has an IP.
# You can see the current status of your virtual machines by issuing:
% nova list

# Finally, we'll log into the virtual machine!
# You'll need to grab the IP from the previous step.
# Note: The default user for instances based on Ubuntu-14.04-LTS-20140607 is 'ubuntu'.
% ssh ubuntu@<instance_ip>
{% endhighlight %}

        <p align="justify">Now that you're logged in to the virtual machine, it's time to play around! You'll notice that the virtual machine looks exactly like an Ubuntu server, and the ubuntu user has full root access. This means you can customize the virtual machine in any way you wish! Feel free to play around for a bit before we move on.</p>

        <h3><a name="extra_commands" class="anchor" href="#extra_commands"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra commands...</h3>

        <p align="justify">The commands we've used so far, <i>nova boot</i> and <i>nova list</i> are but two of a slew of commands available for controlling the OpenStack system. A list of available commands can be printed by issuing the <i>nova</i> commands without any arguments. But let's go over some of the more immediately useful commands. As you'll see, they follow a fairly standard pattern...</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Listing commands:
% nova list         # Running virtual machine instances.
% nova image-list   # Available virtual machine images.
% nova flavor-list  # Available virtual machine flavors.
% nova keypair-list # Loaded ssh keypairs.

# Creation / addition commands:
% nova boot --image <image_name_or_uuid> --flavor <flavor_name_or_id> --key-name <pubkey_name> <instance_name> # Creation of a new virtual machine.
% nova image-create <instance_name_or_uuid> <new_image_name>  # Creation of a new image from a running virtual machine.
% nova keypair-add [--pub-key <pubkey_file>] <pubkey_name>    # Creation and / or addition of a pubkey.

# Deletion / removal commands:
% nova delete <instance_name_or_uuid>     # Deletion of a running virtual machine instance.
% nova image-delete <image_name_or_uuid>  # Deletion of a virtual machine image.
% nova keypair-delete <pubkey_name>       # Deletion of a keypair.

# Detailed information commands:
% nova show <instance_name_or_uuid>     # Shows detailed information on a running virtual machine instance.
% nova image-show <image_name_or_uuid>  # Shows detailed information on a virtual machine image.
% nova flavor-show <flavor_name>        # Shows detailed information on a virtual machine flavor.
% nova keypair-show <pubkey_name>       # Shows detailed information on a keypair.
